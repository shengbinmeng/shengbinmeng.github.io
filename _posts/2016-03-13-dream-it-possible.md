	I will run, I will climb, I will soar
	I'm undefeated
	Jumping out of my skin, pull the chord
	Yeah I believe it
	The past, is everything we were, don't make us who we are
	So I'll dream, until I make it real, and all I see is stars
	It's not until you fall that you fly
	When your dreams come alive you're unstoppable
	Take a shot, chase the sun, find the beautiful
	We will glow in the dark turning dust to gold
	And we'll dream it possible

	I will chase, I will reach, I will fly
	Until I'm breaking, until I'm breaking
	Out of my cage, like a bird in the night
	I know I'm changing, I know I'm changing
	In, into something big, better than before
	And if it takes, takes a thousand lives
	Then It's worth fighting for
	It's not until you fall that you fly
	When your dreams come alive you're unstoppable
	Take a shot, chase the sun, find the beautiful
	We will glow in the dark turning dust to gold
	And we'll dream it possible

	From the bottom to the top
	We're sparking wild fires
	Never quit and never stop
	The rest of our lives
	From the bottom to the top
	We're sparking wild fires
	Never quit and never stop
	It's not until you fall that you fly
	When your dreams come alive you're unstoppable
	Take a shot, chase the sun, find the beautiful
	We will glow in the dark turning dust to gold
	And we'll dream it possible

	We'll dream it possible
	
这是华为消费者业务的品牌歌曲。它有对应的中文填词版《我的梦》。华为或许将是我毕业后的第一个雇主。And we'll dream it possible。
